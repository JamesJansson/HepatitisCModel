Description of methods to determine the HCV prevalence due to migration

This methodology takes the total resident population by place of birth, age, and sex for the years 2001, 2006 and 2011 provided by the ABS.

The simulation takes place in two steps, for the year bands 2001 to 2006 and 2006 to 2011. The difference in the 5 year age bands over five years are calculated, taking into account expected mortality between the years. For example, all the people in the age band 40-45 will age by 5 years from 2001 to 2006, such that they will be in the 45-50 year old band in 2006. As certain proportion of the people in this band will die, and hence will affect the total number of migrants expected in that period. 

The total number of new migrants per age group is spread evenly between the age groups and years. 

The age band 75+ is obviously quite wide. To determine the number of people in 75-80, 80-85 etc age bands, the people in the 75+ group are distributed according to the expected survival curve due to mortality.
