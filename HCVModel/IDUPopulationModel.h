/*
This file describes the assumptions of a population of people who inject drugs (IDU).

The purpose is to get a rough estimate of when people first started injecting drugs, and how long they have been injecting drugs.

Firstly, national estimates of drug use provide information about the age rate of recent and lifetime drug use.

Almost all estimates put male use at double that of female rate, implying that males make up 66.6% of users.
This is fairly consistent across years and sub categories of IDU.

The primary variable that changes the outcome of the rates in this model is that changes in use associated with drug prices increases from 1999 onwards.
